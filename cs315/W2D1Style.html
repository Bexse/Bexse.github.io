        <h3>Features of Blogging</h3>
            <h3>An Example Post#3</h3>
            <p>This is an example post by bex. Date October 5, 2021 </p>

            <p>For me, the main positive feature about blogging is that it provides service to our broader philosophical community in two important ways: 
                first, by providing a relatively low-threshold and egalitarian way to engage in philosophical discussion,
                 and second, by providing mentorship to people who are less networked.</p>   <br>   <br>

            <h3>Importance</h3> <br>
            <p> Blogging affords a way to engage in debate in an open, relatively egalitarian fashion, at least compared to other forms of professional engagement such as workshops, conferences, and the like.
                 Geographical location, financial constraints, and the reach of one’s network can severely limit the extent to which some people can partake in philosophical discussion. Going to conferences and workshops is expensive.
                  Many workshops are on an invitation-only basis. The same is true for other forms of group engagement in what is still a very lonely and sole-authoring field, such as edited volumes and book symposia. By contrast, 
                  blogs are accessible to everyone, and allow everyone to engage and comment. For example, the Prosblogion at its apex had lots of engagement and hits from readers and commenters in Africa and Asia.</p>

            <h3>Futures</h3> <br>
            Over the years, I’ve seen the number of comments decline in the group blogs I was following or involved in. <br>
            <img src="image/image2.JPG" alt="Streat"class="images">     The decline began maybe around 2013, and was certainly noticeable by 2015. It seems people today are still very willing to comment on blogs relating to the profession, but not so much on other blogs. Most of that commenting has moved to Facebook, 
            which is regrettable given that Facebook does not provide a permanent record of discussion in the same way a blog does (in any case, it is not as easily searchable). Moreover, access to discussions on Facebook depends on 
            how well networked you are on that platform (this is also true for philosophy on Twitter, where follower reach is very important). In this way, social media are less egalitarian than blogs. I predict that Facebook will eventually decline as a platform of philosophical engagement, 
            not least because of its embroilment in election meddling and dark ads, and its leaders’ unwillingness to fix these problems. I’m curious as to what will replace Facebook for online engagement in the future (it does not seem people are using PhilPeople in this way yet, but it certainly has potential).
