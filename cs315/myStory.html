    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
        Since childhood, I have taken a deep interest in things around me, textile, water, light, typewriter, medicines, and any somewhat electronics. 
        From all the remarkable things, I encountered in my poor family of five and local neighborhood, medicines, and those old music records (cassettes) inspire me profoundly. 
        Being the last child for the family instantly offers me additional <q> <em>space of thinking</em>.</q>  
        Where I am from, Ethiopia, fulfilling your interest or pursue your education is something you wish but wouldn’t achieve easily.
        Luckily, I defy the societal expectations and brought myself in the spotlight.
        <p>
        I have successfully completed bachelor’s degree and master’s degree in pharmaceutical science at Addis Ababa University (AAU).
        I have worked at AAU as instructor and would reasonably argue I had contributed in some if not all sector of pharmacy in Ethiopia.
        Despite all, buried interest keeps interrogating me to closely examine the future ahead. 
        This in turn, paves the way to make a life changing decision to purse my education further in computer science fields.

        <p>
        Close personal friends graduated from <a href="https://msd.miu.edu/" target="_blank">  Maharishi International University</a> come and rescued me from taking the long and traditional learning methods. 
        To pursue my interest and ambitions joining MIU was the fastest, reliable, and an easy life changing decision I ever made.   
        My goal in attending a graduate program is not solely to become proficient software developer. 
        However, to alter the perception and attitudes of other people and make a feasible change in their life. 
        To accomplish these goals, a greater level of understanding of surrounding, in demand web technologies and technological protocols is inevitable.
        The knowledge and experiences gain from the program will offers an opportunity to fill the specialized talent gap in software development.
        Being part of a solution in societal problems is making the future career and life meaningful.
